CellWars
========

## Short description
A RTS without any units, or formal bases.

## Game environment
The game is played on a board divided into octogonal and square cells, which have different stats.

## Game mechanics
Each cell has a certain amount of energy and generates some over time. Cells may transfer this energy to others in range.

If transferring to an allied cell, this increases the target cell's energy.
If the target is enemy, its energy is reduced.
Cells may receive various upgrades that may periodically attack, reduce energy lost from enemy attacks, ...

## Victory conditions

Players can take over a cell by being the last one to hit them when their energy falls below 0.

Global loss conditions (exhaustive list):

 - If no cell on the game board belongs to them
 - If any other player wins before they do

Global win conditions (exhaustive list):

 - If no enemy cells remain
 - If all their opponents lose

Specific win conditions (_non_exhaustive list):

 - If they have conquered a certain number of cells
 - If they have not lost for a certain amount of time (vs. AI only)
 - If they have sustained a certain amount of cells for some time
 - If they have gained a certain amount of points, gained by accomplishing specific tasks

TL;DR: Conquer as many cells as you can to win (usually). There is only ever one winner per match.

## Game modes

### Player vs. AI
The player fights against one or more computer-controlled opponents.
The AI used is an evolution-tuned utility maximizer: It calculates the expected utility for each
of its possible actions and chooses the action that leads to the highest EU.
The weights used in the calculation of a game state's utility are tuned by a genetic algorithm.
The AI recalculates its options about once per second, or when either a transfer is changed or a cell changes owner.

### Player vs. Player (PvP)
Several players compete against on another.

The game may be hosted on any machine, including that of one of the players.
Some sort of network connection between the host and the players' machines will be required.

### AI vs. AI
Several AIs compete against one another. This mode exists mainly to allow competition between different custom
AIs.

### Co-op modes
All of the above modes have co-op versions, in which the participants may group into an arbitrary amount of teams
of arbitrary size. AI teams may be created by the game admin; they will be made up of a number of AI opponents
roughly equal to the average size of the player teams.

### Notes

 - AIs are not aware that they are playing against other AIs.
 - AIs run in a separate thread from the server, and may in fact run on another machine.

## Modding & Source code
The game was written from the ground up to support modding. Most behaviors are implemented through event buses, which means
that it is very easy to create mods that hook into that event system to accomplish various reactive tasks.
Cell Wars also features an extensive API, which allows modders to easily add features such as game modes or cell upgrades.
